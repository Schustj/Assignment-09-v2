# Assignment-09-v2
 In this assignment I'm creating three graphs for my final project (BIOL 390).
 
 You'll find 3 different code chunks manipulating 2 different datasets from the CDC. You'll find a couple more chunks creating a choropleth map. 
 
 Additionally, you'll find html comments describing how I coded the chunks. Also, I'll add brief descriptions of the graphs and how they should help answer my hypothesis.
